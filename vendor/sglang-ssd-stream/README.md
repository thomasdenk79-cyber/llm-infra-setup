## Free 48 GB of RAM. Keep the speed.

An SSD streaming extension for [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang).
It runs Qwen3.8 Flash-Next without keeping its 48 GB lookup table in RAM. The
required data is loaded from SSD while the GPU is already working, preserving
the model's speed and leaving that memory available for context, cache, and
everything else on the machine.

The model and extension are packaged to work together:

- **Model:**
  [`garnermccloud/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-SSD-Stream`](https://huggingface.co/garnermccloud/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-SSD-Stream)
- **Server:** SGLang's OpenAI-compatible API
- **Model features:** NVFP4, native MTP, tools, images, and long context
- **Extra fixed memory for the 48 GB table:** about 64 MiB

## Start serving

Use Linux with one NVIDIA GPU, a local SSD, and a standard C++ compiler. The
first launch downloads the prepared model, so allow about 140 GiB of disk
space. Installation creates a user-owned environment with the tested upstream
SGLang commit, matching NVIDIA and FlashInfer packages, and the SSD Stream
plugin. It does not alter the NVIDIA driver, system CUDA, system Python, or
operating-system packages. The native SSD reader is prebuilt, so no Rust
toolchain is required.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garnermccloud/sglang-ssd-stream/main/install.sh | sh
~/.local/bin/sglang-ssd-stream serve
```

That starts an OpenAI-compatible API at `http://127.0.0.1:30000/v1`. Hardware
detection selects the validated 131K-context RTX PRO 6000 profile, the
experimental 262K-context DGX Spark profile, or a conservative CPU-offload
profile for smaller Linux x86_64 GPUs. The model stays pinned to the downloaded
revision until you choose to update it. SGLang compiles a few GPU-specific
kernels on first launch with one build job, then reuses its cache. Existing
system CUDA installations and additional SGLang settings are left alone.

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:30000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-SSD-Stream",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Reply with: SSD Stream works"}],
    "max_tokens": 32
  }'
```

Common overrides remain available:

```bash
sglang-ssd-stream serve \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 7778 \
  --api-key "$API_KEY" \
  --context 131072
```

Pass additional SGLang arguments after `--`:

```bash
sglang-ssd-stream serve -- --log-level info
```

## Updates

Software and model updates are separate and explicit. Rerun the installer to
update the isolated SGLang and plugin environment:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garnermccloud/sglang-ssd-stream/main/install.sh | sh
sglang-ssd-stream update-model
```

`update-model` downloads and validates the new prepared snapshot before making
it active. Existing model files are not deleted automatically, so a changed or
withdrawn upstream model cannot erase the revision already on disk.

## Measured performance

### RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell

Matched tests on an RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell used Qwen3.8 Flash-Next NVFP4,
native MTP, CUDA graphs, and a 1,024-token completion:

| RTX PRO 6000 result | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| GPU memory | 96 GB |
| Normal lookup-table RAM | 47.68 GiB |
| SSD Stream working RAM | About 64 MiB |
| RAM returned | About 47.6 GiB |
| Normal RAM-loaded speed | 148.5-156.2 tok/s |
| SSD Stream speed | **164.7 tok/s** |

The 164.7 tok/s run is not a claim that SSD is faster than RAM. Speculative
acceptance varies with generated text. It demonstrates the important result:
the SSD work can be hidden well enough that the lookup table is no longer the
decode bottleneck. Requests dominated by new, random lookup rows measured
126-137 tok/s.

The accepted RTX PRO 6000 configuration also passed:

- native MTP and CUDA graph capture/replay;
- structured tool calls with changing arguments;
- unrelated image requests;
- an 80,011-token retrieval request;
- 120 alternating text, tool, and image requests;
- restart reuse with the Ubuntu VM running;
- no swap, OOM, restart, or host-memory growth.

### DGX Spark (experimental)

| DGX Spark result | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Unified memory | 128 GB |
| Normal lookup-table memory | 47.68 GiB |
| SSD Stream working memory | About 64 MiB |
| Unified memory returned | About 47.6 GiB |
| Normal RAM-loaded speed | Pending hardware run |
| SSD Stream speed | Pending hardware run |

The Linux aarch64 wheel and automatic GB10 profile are included. It pins
[SGLang's SM121 QSA implementation](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/36845)
and starts with 262K context, BF16 KV, FP32 model state, native MTP 3/1/4,
decode CUDA graphs, and one request at a time. Upstream validated that shape on
one DGX Spark with NVFP4 weights, the FP8 table on NVMe, long-context retrieval,
structured tools, sequential requests, and concurrency. SSD Stream's complete
Spark hardware acceptance and performance run is still pending, so the profile
is experimental rather than validated.

### Smaller NVIDIA GPUs (experimental)

RTX 3090, 4090, and 5090-class systems can run the same prepared NVFP4 model by
keeping part of the ordinary model weights in system RAM. SSD Stream still
serves the separate 47.68 GiB lookup table directly from SSD.

The launcher detects a smaller NVIDIA GPU, selects the compatible SGLang kernel,
and starts with a 16K context. It keeps the non-MoE core on the GPU and uses
SGLang's grouped offloader for every large expert block, prefetching one block
at a time.

| GPU memory | Example GPUs | Host memory target |
| ---: | --- | ---: |
| 32 GB | RTX 5090 | 128 GB |
| 24 GB | RTX 3090, RTX 4090 | 128 GB |

Use the normal command:

```bash
sglang-ssd-stream serve
```

The portable profile requires Linux x86_64, at least 24 GB of GPU memory,
compute capability 8.0 or newer, and about 80 GiB of available host memory at
startup. It disables MTP and CUDA graphs because expert weights move across
PCIe for every token, so it will be much slower than the full-GPU RTX PRO
profile. The same grouped path produced exact text and structured tool calls in
a partial-offload hardware simulation; complete 24 and 32 GB acceptance and
performance measurements remain pending.

## How it works

Qwen3.8 Flash-Next includes a 47.68 GiB predictive lookup embedding (PLE)
table. Each token needs only 16 rows from it, and those row addresses are known
before the model reaches the block that consumes them. SSD Stream starts the
reads early and overlaps them with the GPU computation immediately before that
block.

The native reader requests exact 4 KiB pages instead of triggering large mmap
readahead windows:

1. Copy the required row IDs asynchronously into pinned host memory.
2. Deduplicate the filesystem pages touched by those rows.
3. Read the pages concurrently through Rust and `io_uring`.
4. Restore duplicate rows in their original order.
5. Convert FP8 or BF16 staging data on a separate CUDA stream.
6. Synchronize only if the SSD work outlasts the overlapping GPU computation.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Required row IDs] --> B[Rust page planner]
    B --> C[Concurrent io_uring reads]
    C --> D[32 MiB page pool]
    D --> E[Ordered rows]
    E --> F[GPU conversion]
    G[GPU keeps computing] -. overlaps .-> F
    F --> H[Lookup result]
```

There is no multi-gigabyte private row cache. The reader owns a 32 MiB
registered page pool and two 16 MiB pinned staging buffers. Linux may retain
frequently used pages in reclaimable filesystem cache.

The extension is for SGLang; it is not an official SGLang component. It pins
the integration to a tested SGLang revision and verifies the source files it
hooks before starting.

## Development

Release wheels include the native reader. Rust is only needed to change or
build it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/garnermccloud/sglang-ssd-stream.git
cd sglang-ssd-stream
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
MATURIN_PEP517_ARGS="--compatibility manylinux_2_28" uv build --wheel
```

The Rust extension owns only the read hot path. Python retains the SGLang
plugin, model adapter, CUDA events, pinned staging tensors, Triton conversion,
graph replay integration, and tensor-parallel reduction.
